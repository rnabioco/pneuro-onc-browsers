abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Ependymoma (EPN) posterior fossa group A (PFA) has the highest
  rate of recurrence and the worst prognosis of all EPN molecular groups. At relapse,
  it is typically incurable even with re-resection and re-irradiation. The biology
  of recurrent PFA remains largely unknown, however, the increasing use of surgery
  at first recurrence has now provided access to clinical samples to facilitate a
  better understanding of this. METHODS: In this large longitudinal international
  multicenter study, we examined matched samples of primary and recurrent disease
  from PFA patients to investigate the biology of recurrence. RESULTS: DNA methylome
  derived copy number variants (CNVs) revealed large scale chromosome gains and losses
  at recurrence. CNV changes were dominated by chromosome 1q gain and/or 6q loss,
  both previously identified as high-risk factors in PFA, which were present in 23%
  at presentation but increased to 61% at 1 st recurrence. Multivariate survival analyses
  of this cohort showed that cases with 1q gain or 6q loss at 1 st recurrence were
  significantly more likely to recur again. Predisposition to 1q+/6q- CNV changes
  at recurrence correlated with hypomethylation of heterochromatin-associated DNA
  at presentation. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed that 1q+/6q- PFA had significantly
  higher proportions of proliferative neuroepithelial undifferentiated progenitors
  and decreased differentiated neoplastic subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: This study
  provides clinically and preclinically-actionable insights into the biology of PFA
  recurrence. The hypomethylation predisposition signature in PFA is a potential risk-classifier
  for trial stratification. We show that the cellular heterogeneity of PFAs evolves
  largely because of genetic evolution of neoplastic cells.'
