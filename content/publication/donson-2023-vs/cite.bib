 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ependymoma (EPN) posterior fossa group A (PFA) has
the highest rate of recurrence and the worst prognosis of all EPN
molecular groups. At relapse, it is typically incurable even with
re-resection and re-irradiation. The biology of recurrent PFA
remains largely unknown, however, the increasing use of surgery
at first recurrence has now provided access to clinical samples
to facilitate a better understanding of this. METHODS: In this
large longitudinal international multicenter study, we examined
matched samples of primary and recurrent disease from PFA
patients to investigate the biology of recurrence. RESULTS: DNA
methylome derived copy number variants (CNVs) revealed large
scale chromosome gains and losses at recurrence. CNV changes were
dominated by chromosome 1q gain and/or 6q loss, both previously
identified as high-risk factors in PFA, which were present in
23% at presentation but increased to 61% at 1 st recurrence.
Multivariate survival analyses of this cohort showed that cases
with 1q gain or 6q loss at 1 st recurrence were significantly
more likely to recur again. Predisposition to 1q+/6q- CNV changes
at recurrence correlated with hypomethylation of
heterochromatin-associated DNA at presentation. Cellular and
molecular analyses revealed that 1q+/6q- PFA had significantly
higher proportions of proliferative neuroepithelial
undifferentiated progenitors and decreased differentiated
neoplastic subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides
clinically and preclinically-actionable insights into the biology
of PFA recurrence. The hypomethylation predisposition signature
in PFA is a potential risk-classifier for trial stratification.
We show that the cellular heterogeneity of PFAs evolves largely
because of genetic evolution of neoplastic cells.},
