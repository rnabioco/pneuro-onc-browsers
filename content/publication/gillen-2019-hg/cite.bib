 abstract = {Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in
childhood that remains fatal in the majority of children.
Intra-tumoral cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor samples
significantly confounds our understanding of EPN biology,
impeding development of effective therapy. We therefore used
single-cell RNA sequencing to catalog cellular heterogenity in
childhood EPN. PFA subgroup EPNs concealed an undifferentiated
progenitor subpopulation that either differentiated into
subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics, or
transitioned into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Undifferentiated
and mesenchymal PFA subpopulations were associated with a poor
prognosis, providing new therapeutic targets. In conflict with
current classification paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation
proportions were shown to determine bulk-tumor assigned
subgroups. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity provides an
important advance in our understanding of EPN biology.},
