 abstract = {SummaryEpendymoma (EPN) is a devastating childhood brain tumor.
Single-cell analyses have illustrated the cellular heterogeneity
of EPN tumors, identifying multiple neoplastic cell states
including a mesenchymal-differentiated subpopulation which
characterizes the PFA1 subtype. Here, we characterize the EPN
immune environment, in the context of both tumor subtypes and
tumor cell subpopulations using single-cell sequencing
(scRNAseq, n=27), deconvolution of bulk tumor gene expression
(n=299), spatial proteomics (n=54), and single-cell cytokine
release assays (n=12). We identify eight distinct
myeloid-derived subpopulations from which a group of cells,
termed hypoxia myeloid cells, demonstrate features of
myeloid-derived suppressor cells, including IL6/STAT3 pathway
activation and wound healing ontologies. In PFA tumors, Hypoxia
myeloid cells colocalize with mesenchymal-differentiated cells
in necrotic and perivascular niches and secrete IL-8, which we
hypothesize amplifies the EPN immunosuppressive
microenvironment. This myeloid cell driven immunosuppression
will need to be targeted for immunotherapy to effective in this
difficult to cure childhood brain tumor.},
