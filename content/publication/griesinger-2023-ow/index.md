abstract: SummaryEpendymoma (EPN) is a devastating childhood brain tumor. Single-cell
  analyses have illustrated the cellular heterogeneity of EPN tumors, identifying
  multiple neoplastic cell states including a mesenchymal-differentiated subpopulation
  which characterizes the PFA1 subtype. Here, we characterize the EPN immune environment,
  in the context of both tumor subtypes and tumor cell subpopulations using single-cell
  sequencing (scRNAseq, n=27), deconvolution of bulk tumor gene expression (n=299),
  spatial proteomics (n=54), and single-cell cytokine release assays (n=12). We identify
  eight distinct myeloid-derived subpopulations from which a group of cells, termed
  hypoxia myeloid cells, demonstrate features of myeloid-derived suppressor cells,
  including IL6/STAT3 pathway activation and wound healing ontologies. In PFA tumors,
  Hypoxia myeloid cells colocalize with mesenchymal-differentiated cells in necrotic
  and perivascular niches and secrete IL-8, which we hypothesize amplifies the EPN
  immunosuppressive microenvironment. This myeloid cell driven immunosuppression will
  need to be targeted for immunotherapy to effective in this difficult to cure childhood
  brain tumor.
