 abstract = {Medulloblastoma (MB) is a heterogeneous disease in which
neoplastic cells and associated immune cells contribute to
disease progression. To better understand cellular heterogeneity
in MB we profile neoplastic and immune populations in childhood
MB samples using single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry
and deconvolution of transcriptomic data. Neoplastic cells
cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin which
is in part due to the effect of chromosomal copy number gains and
losses. Harmony alignment reveals novel MB
subgroup/subtype-associated subpopulations that recapitulate
neurodevelopmental processes and are associated with clinical
outcomes. We identify discrete photoreceptor-like cells in MB
subgroups GP3 and GP4 and nodule-associated
neuronally-differentiated cells in subgroup SHH. MB immune
infiltrates consist of both developmentally-related
neuron-pruning and antigen presenting myeloid cells. We show that
this MB cellular diversity is recapitulated in genetically
engineered mouse subgroup-specific models of MB. These findings
advance our understanding of both the neoplastic and immune
landscape of MB.},
