abstract: Summary Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in childhood
  that remains fatal in most children. Intra-tumoral cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor
  samples significantly confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development
  of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA sequencing, histology,
  and deconvolution to catalog cellular heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups.
  Analysis of PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated progenitor
  subpopulation that either differentiates into subpopulations with ependymal cell
  characteristics or transitions into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis
  reveals that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in peri-necrotic
  zones. In conflict with current classification paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation
  proportions are shown to determine bulk-tumor-assigned subgroups. We provide an
  interactive online resource that facilitates exploration of the EPN single-cell
  dataset. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity increases understanding of EPN
  biology.
