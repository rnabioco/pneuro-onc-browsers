 abstract = {Summary Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in
childhood that remains fatal in most children. Intra-tumoral
cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor samples significantly
confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development
of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA
sequencing, histology, and deconvolution to catalog cellular
heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups. Analysis of
PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated
progenitor subpopulation that either differentiates into
subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics or transitions
into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis reveals
that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in
peri-necrotic zones. In conflict with current classification
paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation proportions are shown to
determine bulk-tumor-assigned subgroups. We provide an
interactive online resource that facilitates exploration of the
EPN single-cell dataset. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity
increases understanding of EPN biology.},
