abstract: "Background Pediatric high-grade gliomas (PHGG) are aggressive brain tumors
  with five-year survival rates ranging from less than 2% to 20% depending upon subtype.
  PHGG presents differently from patient to patient and is intratumorally heterogeneous,
  posing challenges in designing therapies. We hypothesized that heterogeneity occurs
  because PHGG comprises multiple distinct tumor and immune cell types in varying
  proportions, each of which may influence tumor characteristics. Methods We obtained
  19 PHGG samples from our institution's pediatric brain tumor bank. We constructed
  a comprehensive transcriptomic dataset at the single-cell level using single-cell
  RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), identified known glial and immune cell types, and performed
  differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis. We conducted multi-channel
  immunofluorescence (IF) staining to confirm the transcriptomic results. Results
  Our PHGG samples included three principal predicted tumor cell types: astrocytes,
  oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), and mesenchymal-like cells (Mes). These cell
  types differed in their gene expression profiles, pathway enrichment, and mesenchymal
  character. We identified a macrophage population enriched in mesenchymal and inflammatory
  gene expression as a possible source of mesenchymal tumor characteristics. We found
  evidence of T-cell exhaustion and suppression. Conclusions PHGG comprises multiple
  distinct proliferating tumor cell types. Microglia-derived macrophages may drive
  mesenchymal gene expression in PHGG. The predicted Mes tumor cell population likely
  derives from OPCs. The variable tumor cell populations rely on different oncogenic
  pathways and are thus likely to vary in their responses to therapy."
