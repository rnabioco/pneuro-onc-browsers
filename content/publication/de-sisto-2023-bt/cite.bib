 abstract = {Background Pediatric high-grade gliomas (PHGG) are aggressive
brain tumors with five-year survival rates ranging from less than
2% to 20% depending upon subtype. PHGG presents differently
from patient to patient and is intratumorally heterogeneous,
posing challenges in designing therapies. We hypothesized that
heterogeneity occurs because PHGG comprises multiple distinct
tumor and immune cell types in varying proportions, each of which
may influence tumor characteristics. Methods We obtained 19 PHGG
samples from our institution's pediatric brain tumor bank. We
constructed a comprehensive transcriptomic dataset at the
single-cell level using single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq),
identified known glial and immune cell types, and performed
differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis. We
conducted multi-channel immunofluorescence (IF) staining to
confirm the transcriptomic results. Results Our PHGG samples
included three principal predicted tumor cell types: astrocytes,
oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), and mesenchymal-like cells
(Mes). These cell types differed in their gene expression
profiles, pathway enrichment, and mesenchymal character. We
identified a macrophage population enriched in mesenchymal and
inflammatory gene expression as a possible source of mesenchymal
tumor characteristics. We found evidence of T-cell exhaustion and
suppression. Conclusions PHGG comprises multiple distinct
proliferating tumor cell types. Microglia-derived macrophages may
drive mesenchymal gene expression in PHGG. The predicted Mes
tumor cell population likely derives from OPCs. The variable
tumor cell populations rely on different oncogenic pathways and
are thus likely to vary in their responses to therapy.},
