 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diverse cellular constituents of childhood brain
tumor ependymoma, recently revealed by single cell
RNA-sequencing, may underly therapeutic resistance. Here we use
spatial transcriptomics to further advance our understanding of
the tumor microenvironment, mapping cellular subpopulations to
the tumor architecture of ependymoma posterior fossa subgroup A
(PFA), the commonest and most deadly childhood ependymoma
variant. METHODS: Spatial transcriptomics data from intact PFA
sections was deconvoluted to resolve the histological arrangement
of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types. Key findings were
validated using immunohistochemistry, in vitro functional assays
and outcome analysis in clinically-annotated PFA bulk
transcriptomic data. RESULTS: PFA are comprised of epithelial and
mesenchymal histological zones containing a diversity of cellular
states, each zone including co-existing and spatially distinct
undifferentiated progenitor-like cells; a quiescent mesenchymal
zone population, and a second highly mitotic progenitor
population that is restricted to hypercellular epithelial zones
and that is more abundant in progressive tumors. We show that
myeloid cell interaction is the leading cause of mesenchymal
transition in PFA, occurring in zones spatially distinct from
hypoxia-induced mesenchymal transition, and these distinct
EMT-initiating processes were replicated using in vitro models of
PFA. CONCLUSIONS: These insights demonstrate the utility of
spatial transcriptomics to advance our understanding of
ependymoma biology, revealing a clearer picture of the cellular
constituents of PFA, their interactions and influence on tumor
progression.},
