 abstract = {Plexiform neurofibroma (PN) is a leading cause of morbidity in
children with the genetic condition Neurofibromatosis Type 1
(NF1), often disfiguring or threatening vital structures. During
formation of PN, a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) develops,
with recruitment of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types
being critical for growth and progression. Due to the cohesive
cellularity of PN, single-cell RNA-sequencing is difficult and
may result in a loss of detection of critical cellular
subpopulations. To bypass this barrier, we performed
single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 8 frozen PN samples,
and integrated this with spatial transcriptomics (ST) in 4 PN
samples and immunohistochemistry to provide morphological context
to transcriptomic data. SnRNA-seq analysis definitively charted
the heterogeneous cellular subpopulations in the PN TME, with the
predominant fraction being fibroblast subtypes. PN showed a
remarkable amount of inter-sample homogeneity regarding cellular
subpopulation proportions despite being resected from a variety
of anatomical locations. ST analysis identified distinct cellular
subpopulations which were annotated using snRNA-seq data and
correlated with histological features. Schwann cell/fibroblast
interactions were identified by receptor/ligand interaction
analysis demonstrating a high probability of Neurexin
1/Neuroligin 1 (NRXN1/NLGN1) receptor-ligand cross-talk predicted
between fibroblasts and non-myelinated Schwann cells (NM-SC) and
subtypes, respectively. We observed aberrant expression of NRXN1
and NLGN1 in our PN snRNA-seq data compared to a normal mouse
sciatic nerve single-cell RNA-seq dataset. This pathway has never
been described in PN and may indicate a clear and direct
communication pathway between putative NM-SC cells of origin and
surrounding fibroblasts, potentially driving disease progression.
SnRNA-seq integrated with spatial transcriptomics advances our
understanding of the complex cellular heterogeneity of PN TME and
identify potential novel communication pathways that may drive
disease progression, a finding that could provide translational
therapy options for patients with these devastating tumors of
childhood and early adulthood.},
