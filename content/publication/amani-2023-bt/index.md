abstract: Plexiform neurofibroma (PN) is a leading cause of morbidity in children
  with the genetic condition Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), often disfiguring or
  threatening vital structures. During formation of PN, a complex tumor microenvironment
  (TME) develops, with recruitment of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types being
  critical for growth and progression. Due to the cohesive cellularity of PN, single-cell
  RNA-sequencing is difficult and may result in a loss of detection of critical cellular
  subpopulations. To bypass this barrier, we performed single-nuclei RNA-sequencing
  (snRNA-seq) on 8 frozen PN samples, and integrated this with spatial transcriptomics
  (ST) in 4 PN samples and immunohistochemistry to provide morphological context to
  transcriptomic data. SnRNA-seq analysis definitively charted the heterogeneous cellular
  subpopulations in the PN TME, with the predominant fraction being fibroblast subtypes.
  PN showed a remarkable amount of inter-sample homogeneity regarding cellular subpopulation
  proportions despite being resected from a variety of anatomical locations. ST analysis
  identified distinct cellular subpopulations which were annotated using snRNA-seq
  data and correlated with histological features. Schwann cell/fibroblast interactions
  were identified by receptor/ligand interaction analysis demonstrating a high probability
  of Neurexin 1/Neuroligin 1 (NRXN1/NLGN1) receptor-ligand cross-talk predicted between
  fibroblasts and non-myelinated Schwann cells (NM-SC) and subtypes, respectively.
  We observed aberrant expression of NRXN1 and NLGN1 in our PN snRNA-seq data compared
  to a normal mouse sciatic nerve single-cell RNA-seq dataset. This pathway has never
  been described in PN and may indicate a clear and direct communication pathway between
  putative NM-SC cells of origin and surrounding fibroblasts, potentially driving
  disease progression. SnRNA-seq integrated with spatial transcriptomics advances
  our understanding of the complex cellular heterogeneity of PN TME and identify potential
  novel communication pathways that may drive disease progression, a finding that
  could provide translational therapy options for patients with these devastating
  tumors of childhood and early adulthood.
