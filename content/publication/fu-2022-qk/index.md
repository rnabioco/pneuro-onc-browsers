abstract: "Childhood ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor that has seen limited improvements\
  \ in outcome over past decades. The underlying cellular components of EPN have recently\
  \ been revealed by single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq), providing biological insights.\
  \ Here we use spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively chart gene expression across\
  \ the cellular landscape of posterior fossa subgroup A (PFA) EPN, the commonest\
  \ and most deadly EPN variant, providing novel resolution of cellular heterogeneity\
  \ and cellular interaction. We reveal that PFA are comprised of epithelial and mesenchymal\
  \ histological zones each containing a diversity of cellular states. These include\
  \ co-existing and spatially distinct undifferentiated progenitor-like clusters -\
  \ a quiescent mesenchymal zone population, and a second highly mitotic progenitor\
  \ population that is restricted to hypercellular epithelial zones. We show that\
  \ myeloid cell interaction is the leading cause of mesenchymal transition in PFA,\
  \ occurring in zones spatially distinct from hypoxia-induced mesenchymal transition,\
  \ and these distinct EMT-initiating processes were replicated in in-vitro models\
  \ of PFA. Collectively, our transcriptomic and functional analyses mirror the processes\
  \ of normal wound healing where PFA mesenchymal and epithelial zones interact with\
  \ immune subpopulations in cycle of persistent tissue damage response and mitogenic\
  \ re-epithelialization signals. Spatial transcriptomics advances our understanding\
  \ of PFA biology, implicating a ``wound that will not heal'' process as a driver\
  \ of tumor progression, a new concept that could provide novel targets for effective\
  \ therapeutic intervention. Significance Spatial transcriptomic analysis of the\
  \ ependymoma tumor microenvironment identifies novel cell populations and interactions,\
  \ implicating unresolved wound healing as a clinically actionable driver of tumor\
  \ progression in this refractory childhood brain tumor. ### Competing Interest Statement\
  \ The authors have declared no competing interest."
