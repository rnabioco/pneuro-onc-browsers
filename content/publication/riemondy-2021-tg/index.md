abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma (MB) is a heterogeneous disease in which neoplastic
  cells and associated immune cells contribute to disease progression. We aimed to
  determine the influence of neoplastic and immune cell diversity on MB biology in
  patient samples and animal models. METHODS: To better characterize cellular heterogeneity
  in MB we used single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry and deconvolution
  of transcriptomic data to profile neoplastic and immune populations in patient samples
  and animal models across childhood MB subgroups. RESULTS: Neoplastic cells cluster
  primarily according to individual sample of origin which is influenced by chromosomal
  copy number variance. Harmony alignment reveals novel MB subgroup/subtype-associated
  subpopulations that recapitulate neurodevelopmental processes, including photoreceptor
  and glutamatergic neuron-like cells in molecular subgroups GP3 and GP4, and a specific
  nodule-associated neuronally-differentiated subpopulation in subgroup molecular
  SHH. We definitively chart the spectrum of MB immune cell infiltrates, which include
  subpopulations that recapitulate developmentally-related neuron-pruning and antigen
  presenting myeloid cells. MB cellular diversity matching human samples is mirrored
  in subgroup-specific mouse models of MB. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a clearer
  understanding of the diverse neoplastic and immune cell subpopulations that constitute
  the MB microenvironment.'
