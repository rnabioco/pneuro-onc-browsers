 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma (MB) is a heterogeneous disease in
which neoplastic cells and associated immune cells contribute to
disease progression. We aimed to determine the influence of
neoplastic and immune cell diversity on MB biology in patient
samples and animal models. METHODS: To better characterize
cellular heterogeneity in MB we used single-cell RNA sequencing,
immunohistochemistry and deconvolution of transcriptomic data to
profile neoplastic and immune populations in patient samples and
animal models across childhood MB subgroups. RESULTS: Neoplastic
cells cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin
which is influenced by chromosomal copy number variance. Harmony
alignment reveals novel MB subgroup/subtype-associated
subpopulations that recapitulate neurodevelopmental processes,
including photoreceptor and glutamatergic neuron-like cells in
molecular subgroups GP3 and GP4, and a specific nodule-associated
neuronally-differentiated subpopulation in subgroup molecular
SHH. We definitively chart the spectrum of MB immune cell
infiltrates, which include subpopulations that recapitulate
developmentally-related neuron-pruning and antigen presenting
myeloid cells. MB cellular diversity matching human samples is
mirrored in subgroup-specific mouse models of MB. CONCLUSIONS:
These findings provide a clearer understanding of the diverse
neoplastic and immune cell subpopulations that constitute the MB
microenvironment.},
