We utilized single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (ST), and cytokine analyses to characterize and help better understand tumor and immune cell heterogeneity across pLGG tumors. 

## Data availability

scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and will be released upon publication.

A [UCSC cell browser](https://d1j5ptaq3534zo.cloudfront.net), currently private, will be made available for interactive exploration of the data upon publication.
