We examined matched samples of primary and recurrent disease from PFA EPN patients to investigate the biology of recurrence. single-nuclei RNA-seq was performed on 7 matched pairs of primary and 1st relapse tumors.

## Data and code availability

snRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and methylation data to be deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.

A [UCSC cellbrowser](https://d3sr7cjisx2u5u.cloudfront.net/), currently private, will be made available for interactive exploration of the data upon publication.
