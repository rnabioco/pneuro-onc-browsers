We examined matched samples of primary and recurrent disease from PFA EPN patients to investigate the biology of recurrence. single-nuclei RNA-seq was performed on 7 matched pairs of primary and 1st relapse tumors.

## Data and code availability

snRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and methylation data are deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at accession number [GSE226961](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE226961).

A [UCSC cellbrowser](https://d3sr7cjisx2u5u.cloudfront.net/) is available for interactive exploration of the data.
