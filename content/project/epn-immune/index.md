Ependymoma (EPN) is a devastating childhood brain tumor. Single-cell analyses have illustrated the cellular heterogeneity of EPN tumors, identifying multiple neoplastic cell states including a mesenchymally-differentiated subpopulation which characterizes the PFA1 subtype.  Here, we characterize the EPN immune environment, in the context of both tumor subtypes and tumor cell subpopulations using single-cell sequencing (scRNAseq, n=27), deconvolution of bulk tumor gene expression (n=299), spatial proteomics (n=54), and single-cell cytokine release assays (n=12). We identify eight distinct myeloid-derived subpopulations from which a group of cells, termed hypoxia myeloid cells, demonstrate features of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, including IL6/STAT3 pathway activation and wound healing ontologies. Hypoxia myeloid cells colocalized with mesenchymally-differentiated cells in necrotic and perivascular niches in PFA tumors and secrete IL-8, which we hypothesize amplifies the EPN immunosuppressive microenvironment. Childhood EPN immunotherapy must overcome the myeloid cell driven immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and our data provides new routes for therapeutic innovation in this difficult to treat disease.
