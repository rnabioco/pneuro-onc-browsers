We performed single-cell RNA-Seq on a diverse group of 19 pediatric high-grade glioma (PHGG) patient samples. The samples comprise 5 H3K27M mutant diffuse midline gliomas, 4 epithelioid/giant cell high grade gliomas, 5 radiation induced high grade gliomas, 3 IDH wild-type hemispheric high grade gliomas, 1 diffuse hemispheric glioma H3 G34-mutant and 1 PHGG otherwise unspecified.



## Data availability

scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and methylation data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at accession GSE231860.

A [UCSC cell browser](https://d3kenlgykdgmyv.cloudfront.net) is available for interactive exploration of the data upon.
