single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) was applied retrospectively to 8 frozen plexiform neurofibromas (PN) to characterize the disease tumor microenvironment (TME). Additionally, 4 frozen PN samples were OCT embedded and spatial transcriptomics (ST) was run, adding morphological context to the transcriptomic data generated.

## Data availability

snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and will be released upon publication.

A [UCSC cell browser](https://d2nywbe3ddspri.cloudfront.net), currently private, will be made available for interactive exploration of the data upon publication.
