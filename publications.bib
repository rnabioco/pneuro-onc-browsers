  abstract = "Summary Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in
              childhood that remains fatal in most children. Intra-tumoral
              cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor samples significantly
              confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development
              of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA
              sequencing, histology, and deconvolution to catalog cellular
              heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups. Analysis of
              PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated
              progenitor subpopulation that either differentiates into
              subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics or transitions
              into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis reveals
              that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in
              peri-necrotic zones. In conflict with current classification
              paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation proportions are shown to
              determine bulk-tumor-assigned subgroups. We provide an
              interactive online resource that facilitates exploration of the
              EPN single-cell dataset. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity
              increases understanding of EPN biology.",

  abstract = "Medulloblastoma (MB) is a heterogeneous disease in which
              neoplastic cells and associated immune cells contribute to
              disease progression. To better understand cellular heterogeneity
              in MB we profile neoplastic and immune populations in childhood
              MB samples using single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry
              and deconvolution of transcriptomic data. Neoplastic cells
              cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin which
              is in part due to the effect of chromosomal copy number gains and
              losses. Harmony alignment reveals novel MB
              subgroup/subtype-associated subpopulations that recapitulate
              neurodevelopmental processes and are associated with clinical
              outcomes. We identify discrete photoreceptor-like cells in MB
              subgroups GP3 and GP4 and nodule-associated
              neuronally-differentiated cells in subgroup SHH. MB immune
              infiltrates consist of both developmentally-related
              neuron-pruning and antigen presenting myeloid cells. We show that
              this MB cellular diversity is recapitulated in genetically
              engineered mouse subgroup-specific models of MB. These findings
              advance our understanding of both the neoplastic and immune
              landscape of MB.",
