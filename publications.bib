  abstract = "Summary Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in
              childhood that remains fatal in most children. Intra-tumoral
              cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor samples significantly
              confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development
              of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA
              sequencing, histology, and deconvolution to catalog cellular
              heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups. Analysis of
              PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated
              progenitor subpopulation that either differentiates into
              subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics or transitions
              into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis reveals
              that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in
              peri-necrotic zones. In conflict with current classification
              paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation proportions are shown to
              determine bulk-tumor-assigned subgroups. We provide an
              interactive online resource that facilitates exploration of the
              EPN single-cell dataset. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity
              increases understanding of EPN biology.",

               which neoplastic cells and associated immune cells contribute to
               disease progression. We aimed to determine the influence of
               neoplastic and immune cell diversity on MB biology in patient
               samples and animal models. METHODS: To better characterize
               cellular heterogeneity in MB we used single-cell RNA sequencing,
               immunohistochemistry and deconvolution of transcriptomic data to
               profile neoplastic and immune populations in patient samples and
               animal models across childhood MB subgroups. RESULTS: Neoplastic
               cells cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin
               which is influenced by chromosomal copy number variance. Harmony
               alignment reveals novel MB subgroup/subtype-associated
               subpopulations that recapitulate neurodevelopmental processes,
               including photoreceptor and glutamatergic neuron-like cells in
               molecular subgroups GP3 and GP4, and a specific nodule-associated
               neuronally-differentiated subpopulation in subgroup molecular
               SHH. We definitively chart the spectrum of MB immune cell
               infiltrates, which include subpopulations that recapitulate
               developmentally-related neuron-pruning and antigen presenting
               myeloid cells. MB cellular diversity matching human samples is
               mirrored in subgroup-specific mouse models of MB. CONCLUSIONS:
               These findings provide a clearer understanding of the diverse
               neoplastic and immune cell subpopulations that constitute the MB
               microenvironment.",

  abstract = "Childhood ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor that has seen limited
              improvements in outcome over past decades. The underlying
              cellular components of EPN have recently been revealed by single
              cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq), providing biological insights.
              Here we use spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively chart gene
              expression across the cellular landscape of posterior fossa
              subgroup A (PFA) EPN, the commonest and most deadly EPN variant,
              providing novel resolution of cellular heterogeneity and cellular
              interaction. We reveal that PFA are comprised of epithelial and
              mesenchymal histological zones each containing a diversity of
              cellular states. These include co-existing and spatially distinct
              undifferentiated progenitor-like clusters - a quiescent
              mesenchymal zone population, and a second highly mitotic
              progenitor population that is restricted to hypercellular
              epithelial zones. We show that myeloid cell interaction is the
              leading cause of mesenchymal transition in PFA, occurring in
              zones spatially distinct from hypoxia-induced mesenchymal
              transition, and these distinct EMT-initiating processes were
              replicated in in-vitro models of PFA. Collectively, our
              transcriptomic and functional analyses mirror the processes of
              normal wound healing where PFA mesenchymal and epithelial zones
              interact with immune subpopulations in cycle of persistent tissue
              damage response and mitogenic re-epithelialization signals.
              Spatial transcriptomics advances our understanding of PFA
              biology, implicating a ``wound that will not heal'' process as a
              driver of tumor progression, a new concept that could provide
              novel targets for effective therapeutic intervention.
              Significance Spatial transcriptomic analysis of the ependymoma
              tumor microenvironment identifies novel cell populations and
              interactions, implicating unresolved wound healing as a
              clinically actionable driver of tumor progression in this
              refractory childhood brain tumor. \#\#\# Competing Interest
