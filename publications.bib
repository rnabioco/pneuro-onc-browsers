              confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development
              of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA
              sequencing, histology, and deconvolution to catalog cellular
              heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups. Analysis of
              PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated
              progenitor subpopulation that either differentiates into
              subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics or transitions
              into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis reveals
              that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in
              peri-necrotic zones. In conflict with current classification
              paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation proportions are shown to

               neoplastic and immune cell diversity on MB biology in patient
               samples and animal models. METHODS: To better characterize
               cellular heterogeneity in MB we used single-cell RNA sequencing,
               immunohistochemistry and deconvolution of transcriptomic data to
               profile neoplastic and immune populations in patient samples and
               animal models across childhood MB subgroups. RESULTS: Neoplastic
               cells cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin
               which is influenced by chromosomal copy number variance. Harmony
               alignment reveals novel MB subgroup/subtype-associated
               subpopulations that recapitulate neurodevelopmental processes,
               including photoreceptor and glutamatergic neuron-like cells in
               molecular subgroups GP3 and GP4, and a specific nodule-associated
               neuronally-differentiated subpopulation in subgroup molecular

               developmentally-related neuron-pruning and antigen presenting

               mirrored in subgroup-specific mouse models of MB. CONCLUSIONS:

              the tumor architecture of ependymoma posterior fossa subgroup A
              (PFA), the commonest and most deadly childhood ependymoma
              variant. METHODS: Spatial transcriptomics data from intact PFA
              sections was deconvoluted to resolve the histological arrangement
              of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types. Key findings were
              validated using immunohistochemistry, in vitro functional assays
              and outcome analysis in clinically-annotated PFA bulk
              transcriptomic data. RESULTS: PFA are comprised of epithelial and
              mesenchymal histological zones containing a diversity of cellular
              states, each zone including co-existing and spatially distinct
              undifferentiated progenitor-like cells; a quiescent mesenchymal

              population that is restricted to hypercellular epithelial zones

              myeloid cell interaction is the leading cause of mesenchymal

              hypoxia-induced mesenchymal transition, and these distinct

              the highest rate of recurrence and the worst prognosis of all EPN
              molecular groups. At relapse, it is typically incurable even with
              re-resection and re-irradiation. The biology of recurrent PFA
              remains largely unknown, however, the increasing use of surgery
              at first recurrence has now provided access to clinical samples
              to facilitate a better understanding of this. METHODS: In this
              large longitudinal international multicenter study, we examined
              matched samples of primary and recurrent disease from PFA
              patients to investigate the biology of recurrence. RESULTS: DNA
              methylome derived copy number variants (CNVs) revealed large
              scale chromosome gains and losses at recurrence. CNV changes were
              dominated by chromosome 1q gain and/or 6q loss, both previously
              identified as high-risk factors in PFA, which were present in
              23\% at presentation but increased to 61\% at 1 st recurrence.
              Multivariate survival analyses of this cohort showed that cases
              with 1q gain or 6q loss at 1 st recurrence were significantly
              more likely to recur again. Predisposition to 1q+/6q- CNV changes
              at recurrence correlated with hypomethylation of
              heterochromatin-associated DNA at presentation. Cellular and
              molecular analyses revealed that 1q+/6q- PFA had significantly
              higher proportions of proliferative neuroepithelial
              undifferentiated progenitors and decreased differentiated
              neoplastic subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides
              clinically and preclinically-actionable insights into the biology
              of PFA recurrence. The hypomethylation predisposition signature
              in PFA is a potential risk-classifier for trial stratification.

              children with the genetic condition Neurofibromatosis Type 1
              (NF1), often disfiguring or threatening vital structures. During
              formation of PN, a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) develops,
              with recruitment of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types
              being critical for growth and progression. Due to the cohesive
              cellularity of PN, single-cell RNA-sequencing is difficult and
              may result in a loss of detection of critical cellular
              subpopulations. To bypass this barrier, we performed
              single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 8 frozen PN samples,
              and integrated this with spatial transcriptomics (ST) in 4 PN
              samples and immunohistochemistry to provide morphological context
              to transcriptomic data. SnRNA-seq analysis definitively charted
              the heterogeneous cellular subpopulations in the PN TME, with the
              predominant fraction being fibroblast subtypes. PN showed a
              remarkable amount of inter-sample homogeneity regarding cellular
              subpopulation proportions despite being resected from a variety
              of anatomical locations. ST analysis identified distinct cellular
              subpopulations which were annotated using snRNA-seq data and
              correlated with histological features. Schwann cell/fibroblast
              interactions were identified by receptor/ligand interaction
              analysis demonstrating a high probability of Neurexin
              1/Neuroligin 1 (NRXN1/NLGN1) receptor-ligand cross-talk predicted
              between fibroblasts and non-myelinated Schwann cells (NM-SC) and
              subtypes, respectively. We observed aberrant expression of NRXN1
              and NLGN1 in our PN snRNA-seq data compared to a normal mouse
              sciatic nerve single-cell RNA-seq dataset. This pathway has never
              been described in PN and may indicate a clear and direct
              communication pathway between putative NM-SC cells of origin and
              surrounding fibroblasts, potentially driving disease progression.
              SnRNA-seq integrated with spatial transcriptomics advances our
              understanding of the complex cellular heterogeneity of PN TME and
              identify potential novel communication pathways that may drive
              disease progression, a finding that could provide translational
