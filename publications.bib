  abstract = "Summary Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in
              childhood that remains fatal in most children. Intra-tumoral
              cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor samples significantly
              confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development
              of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA
              sequencing, histology, and deconvolution to catalog cellular
              heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups. Analysis of
              PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated
              progenitor subpopulation that either differentiates into
              subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics or transitions
              into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis reveals
              that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in
              peri-necrotic zones. In conflict with current classification
              paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation proportions are shown to
              determine bulk-tumor-assigned subgroups. We provide an
              interactive online resource that facilitates exploration of the
              EPN single-cell dataset. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity
              increases understanding of EPN biology.",

               which neoplastic cells and associated immune cells contribute to
               disease progression. We aimed to determine the influence of
               neoplastic and immune cell diversity on MB biology in patient
               samples and animal models. METHODS: To better characterize
               cellular heterogeneity in MB we used single-cell RNA sequencing,
               immunohistochemistry and deconvolution of transcriptomic data to
               profile neoplastic and immune populations in patient samples and
               animal models across childhood MB subgroups. RESULTS: Neoplastic
               cells cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin
               which is influenced by chromosomal copy number variance. Harmony
               alignment reveals novel MB subgroup/subtype-associated
               subpopulations that recapitulate neurodevelopmental processes,
               including photoreceptor and glutamatergic neuron-like cells in
               molecular subgroups GP3 and GP4, and a specific nodule-associated
               neuronally-differentiated subpopulation in subgroup molecular
               SHH. We definitively chart the spectrum of MB immune cell
               infiltrates, which include subpopulations that recapitulate
               developmentally-related neuron-pruning and antigen presenting
               myeloid cells. MB cellular diversity matching human samples is
               mirrored in subgroup-specific mouse models of MB. CONCLUSIONS:
               These findings provide a clearer understanding of the diverse
               neoplastic and immune cell subpopulations that constitute the MB
               microenvironment.",

              spatial transcriptomics to further advance our understanding of
              the tumor microenvironment, mapping cellular subpopulations to
              the tumor architecture of ependymoma posterior fossa subgroup A
              (PFA), the commonest and most deadly childhood ependymoma
              variant. METHODS: Spatial transcriptomics data from intact PFA
              sections was deconvoluted to resolve the histological arrangement
              of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types. Key findings were
              validated using immunohistochemistry, in vitro functional assays
              and outcome analysis in clinically-annotated PFA bulk
              transcriptomic data. RESULTS: PFA are comprised of epithelial and
              mesenchymal histological zones containing a diversity of cellular
              states, each zone including co-existing and spatially distinct
              undifferentiated progenitor-like cells; a quiescent mesenchymal
              zone population, and a second highly mitotic progenitor
              population that is restricted to hypercellular epithelial zones
              and that is more abundant in progressive tumors. We show that
              myeloid cell interaction is the leading cause of mesenchymal
              transition in PFA, occurring in zones spatially distinct from
              hypoxia-induced mesenchymal transition, and these distinct
              EMT-initiating processes were replicated using in vitro models of
              PFA. CONCLUSIONS: These insights demonstrate the utility of
              spatial transcriptomics to advance our understanding of
              ependymoma biology, revealing a clearer picture of the cellular

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ependymoma (EPN) posterior fossa group A (PFA) has
              the highest rate of recurrence and the worst prognosis of all EPN
              molecular groups. At relapse, it is typically incurable even with
              re-resection and re-irradiation. The biology of recurrent PFA
              remains largely unknown, however, the increasing use of surgery
              at first recurrence has now provided access to clinical samples
              to facilitate a better understanding of this. METHODS: In this
              large longitudinal international multicenter study, we examined
              matched samples of primary and recurrent disease from PFA
              patients to investigate the biology of recurrence. RESULTS: DNA
              methylome derived copy number variants (CNVs) revealed large
              scale chromosome gains and losses at recurrence. CNV changes were
              dominated by chromosome 1q gain and/or 6q loss, both previously
              identified as high-risk factors in PFA, which were present in
              23\% at presentation but increased to 61\% at 1 st recurrence.
              Multivariate survival analyses of this cohort showed that cases
              with 1q gain or 6q loss at 1 st recurrence were significantly
              more likely to recur again. Predisposition to 1q+/6q- CNV changes
              at recurrence correlated with hypomethylation of
              heterochromatin-associated DNA at presentation. Cellular and
              molecular analyses revealed that 1q+/6q- PFA had significantly
              higher proportions of proliferative neuroepithelial
              undifferentiated progenitors and decreased differentiated
              neoplastic subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides
              clinically and preclinically-actionable insights into the biology
              of PFA recurrence. The hypomethylation predisposition signature
              in PFA is a potential risk-classifier for trial stratification.
              We show that the cellular heterogeneity of PFAs evolves largely
              because of genetic evolution of neoplastic cells.",
